Today we have started the development of [PictograpiDraw](https://draw.pictograpi.com), a new tool of the [PictograpiUniverse](https://pictograpi.com).

This project will be **a drawing board using pictographs and other forms**. We will follow an incremental development so we expect to release a beta version as soon as possible.
