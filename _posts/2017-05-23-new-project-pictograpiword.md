We are so happy to present [PictograpiWord](https://word.pictograpi.com), the first project to join the Pictograpi Universe. This project is a translator from text to pictographs. It has arrived with many functionalities:

- Translate from Spanish also using verbs like: “He comprado”.
- Word chaining to convert phrases like “cepillo de dientes” in just a pictograph.
- Print the document into PDF or with the printer.
- Remove borders and words.
- We are working on next versions, stay tuned!
