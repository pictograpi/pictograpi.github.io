We’ve been working really hard during months to reach the day of today. **This is not only a website about pictographs, it is a whole new universe to work with them.**

**Pictograpi Universe has been designed to give everybody, users, teachers or developers, an easy way to work with pictographs**. Right now we are working in the very first version of our Universe, but we hope we will be able to show you new things soon.

We have walked the first step to build our Pictograpi Universe. This step is [PictograpiWord](https://word.pictograpi.com/), an application to easily translate from text to pictographs.

Thanks to [ARASAAC](http://arasaac.org/) for the pictographs, without them, this project would have been impossible.

**More information coming soon…** [Feel free to contact us](mailto:admin@pictograpi.com), we will be pleased to help you with anything related with the Pictograpi Universe.
